Feature: Test case extraction

  Test cases can be extracted from a source file or directory as a collection of 'file:line' items or objects that
  can then be conveniently arranged for consumption by some other tool (e.g. Cucumber).


  Scenario: Extraction from a file
    Given the following feature file "a_test.feature":
      """
      Feature: A test feature

        Scenario: Test 1
          * some steps

    When test cases are extracted from it
    Then the test cases are provided as objects
