# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
 - Tests inside of `Rule` elements are now taken into account when slicing.

### Removed
  - Removed support for some older versions of the gem's dependencies:
    - CukeModeler `0.x`, CukeModeler `1.x`, and CukeModeler `2.x`. Slicing features with `Rule` elements requires at
      least CukeModeler 3.x, because that is the major version that first modeled rules.
    - Ruby `1.x`. Testing against older Rubies in the current CI ecosystem has become too burdensome and Ruby `1.x` is 
      long past end-of-life. Additionally, CukeModeler `3.x` requires at least Ruby `2.x`.
    
### Changed
  - No longer including every file in the Git repository as part of the gem. Only the files needed for using the 
    gem (and the informative ones like the README) will be packaged into the released gem.
